    "The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks the 500 largest publicly traded US companies. It's often used as a benchmark for the overall performance of the US stock market. In short, it's how the economy is doing in terms of major businesses. Historically, since 1928, the S&P 500 has returned about 10-11% per year on average before inflation and about 7% per year on average after inflation. In 2024, last year's annual return was +24.2%, including dividends. In this experiment, we use the S&P 500 because it's the easiest way to show compound interest."

This experiment shows that, while compound interest is a powerful factor with investing, it isn't everything. It will only get you so far. Regular contributions are necessary to really build wealth over time. Combine that with other investments like gold or real estate and smart investing, I can almost guarantee you will be a millionaire one day. Thank you for reading!\n"
